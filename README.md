# SafetyBox
A multi-user torrent management frontend for sharing a seedbox.

# About
The basic use case for this program is a dedicated seedbox - a private server setup for downloading and seeding torrents - which is shared by a number of users. Sharing torrents allows users to find or subscribe to content that they are likely to want to download, while saving on bandwidth and disc space by avoiding redundant torrents.

# Features
Currently none, this is in alpha, sorry guys. =D
